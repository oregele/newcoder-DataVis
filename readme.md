This is the completion of the Data Visualization tutorial for the NewCoder Python tutorial.

The tutorial is meant to go over:
* Running a python file from the command line
* Importing a Python file
* Parsing a raw file with Python data structures
* Making graphs
* producing GeoJSON files for mapping

but also:

* Importing standard and custom libraries and modules
* Installing third party packages (observing their licenses)
* File I/O
* Counter data structure from Collections module
* Global variables, docstrings and list comprehensions
* Python's interactive shell in terminal
* Iterators versus Generators

and finally...

* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* GeoJSON (similar to TopoJSON) using geojson module
